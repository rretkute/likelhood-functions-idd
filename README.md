This is the R code associated with the paper,  Retkute, Minter and Hollingsworth "Formulating likelihood functions for infectious disease dynamics for neglected tropical diseases".

This code was tested with R version 3.6.3 on Windows 

Run these files:

- `01_Trachoma.R`: reproduces Figures 1 and 2.

- `02_Leprosy.R`:  reproduces Figure 3.
