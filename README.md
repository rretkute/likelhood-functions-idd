# Formulating likelihood functions for infectious disease dynamics


This is the R code associated with the paper,  Retkute and Minter "Formulating likelihood functions for infectious disease dynamics".

This code was tested with R version 3.6.3 on Windows 

Run these files:

- `01_Influenza.R`: reproduces Figure 1.

- `02_COVID19.R`:  reproduces Figure 2.

- `03_COVID19_sensitivity.R`:  reproduces Figure 3.

- `04_Negative_Binomial.R`:  reproduces supplementary Figure 1..

The `R` folder contains a set of costum functions needed to run the code.
